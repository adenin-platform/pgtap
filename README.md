pgTAP 1.3.5
===========

[pgTAP](https://pgtap.org) is a unit testing framework for PostgreSQL written
in PL/pgSQL and PL/SQL. It includes a comprehensive collection of
[TAP](https://testanything.org)-emitting assertion functions, as well as the
ability to integrate with other TAP-emitting test frameworks. It can also be
used in the xUnit testing style. For detailed documentation, see the
documentation in `doc/pgtap.mmd` or
[online](https://pgtap.org/documentation.html "Complete pgTAP Documentation").

pgTAP must be installed on a host with PostgreSQL server running; it cannot
be installed remotely.

To build it, just do this:

```sh
make
make install
make installcheck
```

If you encounter an error such as:

```
"Makefile", line 8: Need an operator
```

You need to use GNU make, which may well be installed on your system as
`gmake`:

```sh
gmake
gmake install
gmake installcheck
```

If you encounter an error such as:

```
make: pg_config: Command not found
```
Or:

```
Makefile:52: *** pgTAP requires PostgreSQL 9.1 or later. This is .  Stop.
```

Be sure that you have `pg_config` installed and in your path. If you used a
package management system such as RPM to install PostgreSQL, be sure that the
`-devel` package is also installed. If necessary tell the build process where
to find it:

```sh
env PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config make && make install && make installcheck
```

And finally, if all that fails, copy the entire distribution directory to the
`contrib/` subdirectory of the PostgreSQL source tree and try it there without
`pg_config`:

```sh
env NO_PGXS=1 make && make install && make installcheck
```

If you encounter an error such as:

```
ERROR:  must be owner of database regression
```

You need to run the test suite using a super user, such as the default
"postgres" super user:

```
make installcheck PGUSER=postgres
```

If you encounter an error such as:

```
ERROR: Missing extensions required for testing: citext isn ltree
```

Install the PostgreSQL
[Additional Supplied Modules](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/contrib.html),
which are required to run the tests. If you used a package management system
such as RPM to install PostgreSQL, install the `-contrib` package.

To install the extension in a custom prefix on PostgreSQL 18 or later, pass
the `prefix` argument to `install` (but no other `make` targets):

```sh
make install prefix=/usr/local/extras
```

Then ensure that the prefix is included in the following [`postgresql.conf`
parameters]:

```ini
extension_control_path = '/usr/local/extras/postgresql/share:$system'
dynamic_library_path   = '/usr/local/extras/postgresql/lib:$libdir'
```

Once pgTAP is installed, you can add it to a database by connecting as a super
user and running:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgtap;
```

If you've upgraded your cluster to PostgreSQL 9.1 and already had pgTAP
installed, you can upgrade it to a properly packaged extension with:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgtap FROM unpackaged;
```

If you want to install pgTAP and all of its supporting objects into a specific
schema, use the `SCHEMA` clause to specify the schema, like so:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgtap SCHEMA tap;
```

Development Environment
-----------------------

For development and testing, you can use the provided devcontainer configuration which includes PostgreSQL 17 and all necessary dependencies:

1. Open the repository in VS Code
2. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or run the "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" command
3. The devcontainer will automatically:
   - Install PostgreSQL 17 with contrib extensions
   - Install all build dependencies (make, perl, patch, etc.)
   - Start the PostgreSQL service
   - Set up a development database

Once the container is running, you can build pgTAP with:

```sh
make
```

This will generate the required SQL files:
- `sql/pgtap.sql`
- `sql/uninstall_pgtap.sql`
- `sql/pgtap-core.sql`
- `sql/pgtap-schema.sql`

Dependencies
------------

pgTAP requires PostgreSQL 9.1 or higher.
